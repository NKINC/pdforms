     * <br>
     * A text extraction renderer that keeps track of relative position of text on page
     * The resultant text will be relatively consistent with the physical layout that most
     * PDF files have on screen.
     * <br>
     * This renderer keeps track of the orientation and distance (both perpendicular
     * and parallel) to the unit vector of the orientation.  Text is ordered by
     * orientation, then perpendicular, then parallel distance.  Text with the same
     * perpendicular distance, but different parallel distance is treated as being on
     * the same line.
     * <br>
     * This renderer also uses a simple strategy based on the font metrics to determine if
     * a blank space should be inserted into the output.
